# Lab 3: Developers Setup

## Overview
In this lab, we setup our dev board to boot off of a TFTP server in our Ubuntu virtual machine. First we configure our TFTP and NFS server and setup a file system. We also had to configure networking between the dev-board and the virtual machine. Then we set enviromental varibles and configured a u-boot script. Lastly we crosscompiled and uploaded a hello world file to prove functionality of the setup.
