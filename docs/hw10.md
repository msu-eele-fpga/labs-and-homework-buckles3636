# Lab 10: RGB LED Controller in VHDL

## Overview

This lab involved designing an RGB LED controller using the PWM controller from Lab 8. The controller allows independent duty cycle control for red, green, and blue channels, enabling color mixing for a common cathode RGB LED.

## Assigned Base Address

My assigned base address for the RGB LED controller is **0x1A2730**.

### System Design

The RGB LED controller was simply 3 instances of `hdl/pwm_controller.vhd`. Three PWM controllers are interfaced with memory-mapped registers in `quartus/hw10/pwm_controller_avalon`.

- **Register 0:** PWM period  
- **Register 1:** Red duty cycle  
- **Register 2:** Green duty cycle  
- **Register 3:** Blue duty cycle  

### Current Limiting Resistor Calculations

To calculate the required resistors for each LED color:

- **Source Voltage:** 3.3V  
- **Max Current:** 20mA  

\[
R = \frac{V_{source} - V_{f}}{I}
\]

- **Red LED (Vf = 2.1V):**  
  \[
  R = \frac{2.1V}{0.02A} = 105\Omega
  \]

- **Green/Blue LEDs (Vf = 3.1V):**  
  \[
  R = \frac{3.3V}{0.02A} = 165\Omega
  \]


#### Results

- **Red:**
