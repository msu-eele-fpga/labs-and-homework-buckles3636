# Homework 6: Async-Conditioner

## Overview
In this lab we utilized the signal tap logic analyzer in quartus to check the hardware functionality of the led_patterns file. We monitored each pattern generator as well as the led output. We were supposed to monitor the "current_state" signal as well but I could not get this to populate in quartus. For this we used 5120 bits of memory and 862 logic elements.
